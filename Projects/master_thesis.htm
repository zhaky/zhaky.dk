    <p>The master thesis is a theoretical work on the concept of gamification. Gamification is a concept that was coined in 2002 and became significantly more popular in 2010. The concept is expected by Gartner's Hype Cycle to be commonly used by companies and organizations in 2019 at the earliest. To try and answer how gamification can be used to elicit and nurture intrinsic motivation towards non-artificial feats, this master thesis gives insights into: what gamification is; how it works; why it sometimes works and sometimes does not; where it comes from; and what are some of the advantages and pitfalls of gamification. At the end it features a suggestion on how gamification can be used to elicit and nurture extrinsic motivations toward non-artificial feats. The basic meaning of gamification is to make non-game contexts into games by applying game design elements to the non-game contexts. It differs from traditional game design, as the games designed through gamification, are designed with a secondary objective of eliciting and nurturing intrinsic motivation towards non-artificial feats such as learning, working, and other real-life activities that may benefit from increased intrinsic motivation. When humans are intrinsically motivated towards an activity, their performance and creativity increases in regard to the activity. By the use of game design elements in gamifying non-game contexts, gamification is an attempt to use intrinsic motivation to increase performance and creativity of non-artificial feats. Games are a natural way for humans to simulate, play with, and explore scenarios inside an artificial universe, a magic circle. Inside this magic circle the players can increase and decrease their perception of the challenges they face, making it easier to enter and maintain a state of flow. Flow is also a perfect condition for learning to happen, as flow is a state without either boredom or anxiety. Boredom can result in the player's attention being divided or directed towards other things, while anxiety can overwhelm the player's attention. Both boredom and anxiety can make it dificult to concentrate, and anxiety can even impair learning. While in flow the player is completely engaged in the activity, and his or her entire attention is directed towards the activity. By making non-game contexts into games by gamifying them, it becomes easier to enter and maintain flow as well as apply elements that connect the non-artificial activity to the three components of intrinsic motivation: relatedness, autonomy, and competence. The process of gamifying non-game contexts follows most of the same procedures used in game design, so by looking into the fundamental procedure of game design, this master thesis features an attempt to use those fundamentals to create a guide for gamifying non-game contexts. The guide is focused on using game-design procedures to elicit and nurture intrinsic motivation towards non-artificial feats, thus it gives suggestions on how to use game design to connect game design elements to the components of intrinsic motivation.</p>
