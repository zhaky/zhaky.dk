    <h1>A bit about me and what I do</h1>
    <p>
        My name is Mikkel, my usual online name (in games, on SoMe etc.) is Zhaky (or ZhakyDK, Zhakie or some alteration of that). I'm currently unemployed, so I spent much time: working on this here website; apply for jobs; play games; and improve other skills. Among other skills I work on or plan to be working on soon are: Angular.js, Batch programming, Bootstrap, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SQL, Auto Hotkey, communication psychology, motivational psychology, gamification, workout, meditation, yoga, Trello/Scrum and Git.
    </p>
    <p>
        As part of improving those skills, I have this website and other projects I work on that require one or more of these skills. You can read more about them on my <button class="link" onclick="changePage('content_area','projects.htm')">Projects</button> page.
